how an engineer would do it:
1. pick out boxes
2.



using @ media query vs. linked css
@media=few big http requests
    example: "
    @media screen and (max-width: 400 px){
        body { backgroud-color: red;}
        }
        "

linked css=many small http requests

make sure you have img, embed, object, video {
    max-width: 100%
    }

    look at content to look at breakpoints:


flexbox: default is row, add flex-wrap:wrap to have it go to next line
column drop:

layout shifter-most responsive layout

hidden columns: hides columns based on their importance and screen size

 no more tables, and


Grid based layout framework:
framework=collections of css classes that make layout easy to implement

responsive web pages:
 resolution of screen in pixels to ensure uniformity across all screens
 size of certain aspects changes as size of screen changes

look up flex-wrap:wrap:
it makes columns align next to each other if their width is defined

negative space: added using padding, margin
padding on inside, margin on outside

overflow: text can scroll: "overflow: auto"
overflow is useful for small area

media specific css:
"@media only screen and (max-width: 300px) {
    p {
    background-color: blue;
    display: none;"
    }
}

minified css files

Video: Minified CSS Files
To use the Bootstrap files in your project just copy the css and
 js folders to your project folder. Don't forget to include the
 files in your head element:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min.css"> <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

NOTE: CSS minification does not happen automatically by default,
therefore if you edit your unminified CSS file,
but include the minified version in your HTML,
the page will not use the updated CSS by default.
You can manually minify your CSS using a site like http://cssminifier.com/.
You can also use a more advanced and automated workflow where CSS files get
 minimized automatically, for example using a plugin for your code editor or
 a build system like Gruntjs.
